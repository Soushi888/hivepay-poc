# HivePay Proof of Concept

This is a little PoC of [HivePay](https://hivepay.io) made with [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev).

Three test products are in the `product` store that is located here : `src/stores`.

[Demo](https://hivepay-poc.netlify.app)


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
